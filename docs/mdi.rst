Governed Metrics Service
========================

Master data items is one of the building stones for a successfull self-service

easy and maintainable we propose a combination of the following two services:

`The Governed Metrics Service https://connect.kammeradv.dk/RDWeb/Pages/da-DK/login.aspx?ReturnUrl=/RDWeb/Pages/da-DK/Default.aspx`_
`Inspari Master Data Items Service (Link is missing) `_
